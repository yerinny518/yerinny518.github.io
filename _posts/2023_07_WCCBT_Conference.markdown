I attended 10th WCCBT as a Ph.D. student. This conference comprised an enlightening presentations and poster sessions, which significantly contribued to the development of a valuable foundation for my future research endeavors. Additionally, this experience facilitated meaningful connections with researchers from diverse nations, affording me the opportunity to engage in exchanges of ideas and knowledge.  



These are the two main talks that were memorable: 

> Digital Mental Health: Opportunities and Challenges (Sabine Wilhelm, Harvard Medical School, USA)

> Digital interventions for repetitive negative thought (Edward Watkins)
